For this assignment I needed to defer to resources heavily to accomplish it. However, I think I figured everything out but random.shuffle, which eludes me. 
1st I figured out how to use opperators in Python by going down the initial few questions. After that, Data-types by using the type function, then using a few different systems to convert data between types. After that I figured out lists and randomization. Randomization was easy, lists were... Hard. The last question taught me how to use if/else statements. I still maintain that I have a very hard time using the vernacular of programming. There's a degree in seperation of concepts that makes it very easy to misspeak.
